Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality worldwide It often diagnosed too late due to subtle  early symptoms and limited access to diagnostic tools. Timely identification of high-risk 
patients can significantly improve outcomes through early intervention and personalized care. 

Objectives 
This project focuses on creating a smart system that can predict a person’s risk of heart failure using their medical and personal information. By analyzing patient data with machine learning, 

it aims to: 
a) Find the most important factors that contribute to heart failure. 
b) Build a model that groups patients based on their risk levels. 
c) Offer useful insights to help doctors take early action and manage healthcare resources better.
